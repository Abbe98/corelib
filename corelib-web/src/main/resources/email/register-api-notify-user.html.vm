<p>Dear Europeana API user,</p>

<p>Thank you for registering for the new Europeana API. These are your Europeana API keys:</p>

<p style="font-family:Courier,Courier New">==========<br/>
API key      : ${apiKey.id}<br/>
Private key  : ${apiKey.privateKey}<br/>
==========</p>

<p>Use the API key in your API calls. This key does not need to be kept confidential.<br/>
The private key must be kept confidential and must not be exposed in user interfaces or in markup.<p>

<p>Our technical documentation is available at http://www.europeana.eu/portal/api-introduction.html including an API-console for testing the API and community developed libraries for a variety of programming languages.</p>

<p>Please join us at the Europeana API Forum - https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/europeanaapi - to ask questions to us and other developers and to give us your feedback on our new API. You can also contact us directly by mailing api@europeana.eu and we'd be especially grateful if you would let us know about your implementation so that we can feature it in our application gallery!</p>

<p>Best regards,<br/>
The Europeana API Team</p>
