Dear Europeana API user,

Thank you for registering for the new Europeana API. These are your Europeana API keys:

==========
API key      : ${apiKey.id}
Private key  : ${apiKey.privateKey}
==========

Use the API key in your API calls. This key does not need to be kept confidential.
The private key must be kept confidential and must not be exposed in user interfaces or in markup.

Our technical documentation is available at http://www.europeana.eu/portal/api-introduction.html including an API-console for testing the API and community developed libraries for a variety of programming languages.

Please join us at the Europeana API Forum - https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/europeanaapi - to ask questions to us and other developers and to give us your feedback on our new API. You can also contact us directly by mailing api@europeana.eu and we'd be especially grateful if you would let us know about your implementation so that we can feature it in our application gallery!

Best regards,
The Europeana API Team
